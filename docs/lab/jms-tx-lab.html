              Inspect the result in JConsole. The dining queue should have 0 messages, and the confirmation queue should have 5 messages.  The ConfirmationLister should show 5 confirmations in the database.  Run the <code class="literal">StartReceiver</code> process to consume all the 5 confirmation messages.
        </p></li><li><p>
              Cause an error after receiving the message. In the JConsole, navigate to the rewards/DiningListener MBean and set its <code class="literal">CauseErrorAfterReceiving</code> attribute to true.

    first section, you'll look at an existing application that doesn't use JMS
    transactions which receives message from a JMS queue, stores them in a
    database and sends some response messages. You will learn what errors this
    can cause. In the second section, you'll rework the application to use
    local JMS transactions to solve some of these errors. You'll see in what
    scenarios local JMS transactions can help to solve all issues, and when
    global transaction might be necessary instead.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4674"></a>3.1.&nbsp;Inspecting and Running the Current Application</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><p class="title"><b>The existing application performs the following steps:</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>Picks up <code class="classname">Dining</code> request messages from a

          <code class="classname">RewardNetwork</code></p></li><li><p>Sends the resulting <code class="classname">RewardConfirmation</code>
          as a response message to another queue</p></li></ol></div><p>Ideally, these operations should be <span class="emphasis"><em>atomic</em></span>:
      either all should succeed, or none of them should. Let's see why this is
      currently not the case.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4702"></a>3.1.1.&nbsp;Step 1: Inspect the current application</h4></div></div></div><p>Open the <span class="emphasis"><em>jms-tx</em></span> project. This project
        consists of three parts: a <span class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> that implements
        the use case as described above, a <span class="emphasis"><em>sender</em></span> that
        sends a couple of new <code class="classname">Dining</code> requests as JMS
        messages to the request queue, and a <span class="emphasis"><em>receiver</em></span>
        that takes confirmation messages from the confirmation queue and
        prints them. Our interest is in the server. Inspect the
        <code class="filename">infrastructure-config.xml</code> file. Notice how it
        defines a local transaction manager for an embedded Derby database
        (the <code class="classname">DataSourceTransactionManager</code>) and an
        embedded ActiveMQ connection factory with a broker that can be
        accessed from other applications using a TCP connector.</p><p>Now open the <code class="filename">jms-rewards-config.xml</code>. This
        config file imports the bean definitions for the reward network
        application and defines a JMS listener that processes messages from a
        queue called <span class="emphasis"><em>rewards.queue.dining</em></span> using a
        <code class="classname">DefaultMessageListenerContainer</code> that's defined
        using Spring's <span class="emphasis"><em>jms:</em></span> namespace. The actual logic
        of the server application is implemented in this
        <code class="classname">DiningListener</code>: open it and confirm that the
        code implements the flow described before in its
        <code class="methodname">onMessage</code> implementation. Responses are sent
        to a queue called <span class="emphasis"><em>rewards.queue.confirmation</em></span>, as
        configured in the <code class="classname">JmsTemplate</code> that's injected
        into the <code class="classname">DiningListener</code>. Notice that this class
        has various flags that can be set to cause errors at runtime: you'll
        use those in the next section. When you understand the setup of the
        server application, move to the next step.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4757"></a>3.1.2.&nbsp;Step 2: Run the application</h4></div></div></div><p>Start the server by running the
        <code class="classname">StartServer</code> class. This will bootstrap the
        database and JMS broker, and the server will wait for messages to come
        in on the <span class="emphasis"><em>rewards.queue.dining</em></span> queue.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">To stop the server when you're done with it, click in the
        Console view and press Enter. *Don't* press the Terminate stop button,
        as that will not properly close down the Derby database! In contrast
        to most other labs, we use persistent data in this lab and killing the
        VM will cause issues when restarting the database.</td></tr></table></div><p>Since we want to use JMX to examine the server instance, stop it
        now, as we just described. Then, go to Run... | Run Configurations...
        Select Start Server under Java Application, and add
        '-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote' to the VM arguments; click
        Run.</p><p>To send some messages to the server, run the
        <code class="classname">StartSender</code> class in the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>rewards.messaging.client.sender</em></span> package. This
        class simply sends five messages to the dining queue for processing
        and then exits. In the Console view for the
        <code class="classname">StartServer</code> process, you should now see output
        similar to this:</p><pre class="programlisting">

      just fine. However, with various JMS and JDBC operations involved, there
      are chances that things don't go as planned at runtime. In a typical
      production environment, both the database server and message broker
      would be running on a remote server, for example: that means that a
      network error could cause some operations to fail. In this section
      you'll simulate those failures to observe the result in the

        the application. To show how this can cause errors, switch back to
        JConsole again. Navigate to the

        can configure ActiveMQ on how it should do redeliveries: how often
        should it retry before giving up, how long should it wait between
        redeliveries, etc. If you're interested, have a look in
        <code class="filename">infrastructure-config.xml</code> at the properties that
        are available on the
        <code class="classname">org.apache.activemq.RedeliveryPolicy</code> that's
        configured.</p><p>However, our error is not transient, so the redelivery doesn't
        help. To prevent a message that cannot be processed from blocking the
        entire application, ActiveMQ will move the message to a so-called
        <span class="emphasis"><em>dead letter queue</em></span> after the maximum number of
        redeliveries it's configured with (3, in our case). Use JConsole to
        verify that there's a new dead letter queue defined now that has our 5
        messages.</p><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="95%"><tr><td><img src="images/dlq.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div><p>This is much better, as messages don't get lost anymore.
        However, it doesn't take care of all problems, as we'll see in the
        next step.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4994"></a>3.2.3.&nbsp;Step 6: Cause an error after processing the message</h4></div></div></div><p>Using JConsole, reset the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>CauseErrorAfterReceiving</em></span> flag by setting it to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>false</em></span> again, but this time set the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>CauseErrorAfterProcessing</em></span> flag to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>true</em></span>. As you can see in the code for the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>DiningListener</em></span>, this causes an exception to be
        thrown <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the call to
        <code class="methodname">rewardAccountFor(Dining)</code>, which means that
        the database has already been updated. An example of how this could
        happen in a real system is when a database transaction commits
        successfully, but the subsequent JMS transaction commit fails because
        of a network issue.</p><p>Run the <code class="classname">StartSender</code> application again to
        send 5 new messages. The output in the console will be very similar to
        what you just saw; each message will be redelivered three times and
        then sent to the dead letter queue. However, check the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>NrOfConfirmations</em></span> attribute of the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>ConfirmationLister</em></span> again: it has just increased
        by 20! What happened is that each message was received, processed, and
        then rolled back to be put back in the queue four times (1 delivery
        plus 3 redeliveries). The rollback of the JMS transaction happens
        <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the local database transaction has already
        been committed!</p><p>Using local transactions, there's not much we can do to avoid
        these duplicate messages. Had processing been idempotent, then this
        wouldn't matter, but in our case we want to avoid processing a message
        more than once. One way to deal with this is to detect redeliveries
        and don't process them if they have been processed successfully
        already. To completely avoid these duplicates however, we need a
        *global transaction*: only this guarantees so-called
        <span class="emphasis"><em>once-and-once-only</em></span> delivery.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5039"></a>3.2.4.&nbsp;Step 7: Cause an error after sending the confirmation
        message</h4></div></div></div><p>Also try what happens if you reset the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>CauseErrorAfterProcessing</em></span> flag and set the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>CauseErrorAfterSending</em></span> flag to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>true</em></span>. In this case, the sending happens with a
        transactional <code class="classname">JmsTemplate</code> which will
        automatically use the same JMS <code class="classname">Session</code> as was
        used for receiving the <code class="classname">Dining</code> message: this
        means that the JMS transaction will still roll back, including the
        sending of the confirmation, but only after the database transaction
        has been committed already. The net effect is the same as with the
        previous step. Had we not used a transactional template, then the
        confirmations would be sent while the receive would be rolled back.
        That would be pretty bad: you'd inform clients that you've processed
        their requests once, where in reality you'll see them again because
        they were put back on the queue.</p><p>Stop the server now by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> in
        the Console window. In the next module, you'll see how a global
        transaction can help us out if we require once-and-once-only delivery
        guarantees.</p></div></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="jms-lab.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="tx-xa-lab.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">jms: Simplifying Messaging with Spring's JMS Support&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><span style="color:white;font-size:90%;"><a href="http://www.springsource.com/" title="SpringSource">By SpringSource</a></span></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;tx-xa: Using Global JTA Transactions</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
